Do Do is the multiplayer platform game we developed in 48 hours during Global Game Jam 2015 event.
The game consists of various puzzles that can only be solved by cooperation of the two players.
The 2015 GGJ took place from 23 to 25 January with 28,837 participants in 518 registered jam sites in 518 locations (78 countries). 5438 games were created.
The theme of GGJ15 was "What do we do now?" and at the beginning of the game, 3 characters land into an unknown planet and their space-ship break down.
They see a city far away and they decide to reach there. However, soon they will figure out that they have to act together (what do WE do now?) to successfully reach the city.
