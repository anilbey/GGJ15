# GGJ15

The theme of GGJ15 was "What do we do now?" and at the beginning of the game, 3 characters land into an unknown planet and their space-ship break down.
They see a city far away and they decide to reach there. However, soon they will figure out that they have to act together (what do WE do now?) to successfully reach the city.
